## 📝 Important Notes

**Server Stubs**: The current server implementation uses placeholder handlers that return empty arrays. This is clearly marked in the code with comments like "This is a placeholder declaration!" When you implement the actual database handlers, the frontend will automatically display real data without any changes needed.

**Stub Usage Indicators**: The UI includes helpful messages when no data is present, explaining what users can expect once data is available:
- "No transactions yet. Add your first transaction above! 💳"
- "💡 Spending progress will appear here once you add transactions"
- "No budget data available. Set up budgets to track your spending limits."

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Make sure your server is running with the tRPC endpoints
2. Implement the database handlers to replace the stubs
3. Start adding categories, then transactions, then budgets
4. Use the dashboard to visualize your financial data

The application is designed to be intuitive and guides users through the setup process with helpful tips and suggestions throughout the interface.
