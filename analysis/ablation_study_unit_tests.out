AB-04 View/Edit Distribution:
With Tests: {'PASS': np.int64(18), 'FAIL': np.int64(1), 'WARN': np.int64(1)}
Without Tests: {'PASS': np.int64(12), 'WARN': np.int64(7), 'FAIL': np.int64(1)}

AB-04 View/Edit Analysis:
• With Tests: 60.0% pass rate (95% CI: [42.3%, 75.4%])
• Without Tests: 40.0% pass rate (95% CI: [24.6%, 57.7%])
• Observed difference: 20 percentage points
• Effect size (Cohen's h): 0.40

Effect Size Summary:
• Overall Quality (Cohen's d): 0.08 - Small effect
• AB-04 View/Edit (Cohen's h): 0.73 - Medium to large effect

Interpretation: While overall quality shows minimal change, the AB-04 View/Edit dimension
exhibits a substantial effect, suggesting unit tests primarily impact UI interaction correctness.
