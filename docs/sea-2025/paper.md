Submission to: NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Scaling Environments for Agents (SEA) — see website: [SEA Workshop @ NeurIPS 2025](https://sea-workshop.github.io/)

### Abstract
Short, single‑paragraph summary of the problem, proposed approach, key results, and main takeaways. Keep within ~150–200 words.

### Keywords
agents; environments; LLMs; evaluation; scaling; multi‑agent; tool‑use; sim‑to‑real

### 1. Introduction
- Context and motivation: role of scalable, interactive environments for agent capabilities.  
- Problem statement and limitations of current benchmarks/environments.  
- Summary of contributions.

### 2. Background and Related Work
- Prior work on environment infrastructure, interactive LLM agents, evaluation protocols, and multi‑agent simulation.  
- Benchmarks and datasets relevant to SEA.  
- How this work differs and advances the field.

### 3. Problem Setup and Contributions
- Formalize the environment/agent interaction setting (observations, actions, tasks, rewards, metrics).  
- Enumerate contributions (e.g., framework, dataset, metric suite, deployment tools).

### 4. Method
- System overview and architecture.  
- Environment design: tasks, tools, interaction modalities, and fidelity.  
- Agent integration: prompting, policies, training/fine‑tuning, and memory.  
- Evaluation protocol: metrics for multi‑step interactions, generalization, and robustness.

### 5. Experimental Setup
- Environments, tasks, datasets, and baselines.  
- Implementation details and compute budget.  
- Hyperparameters and reproducibility notes.

### 6. Results
- Main results with figure/table references.  
- Comparisons to baselines and ablations summary.  
- Statistical significance and uncertainty where applicable.

### 7. Analysis and Ablations
- Error analysis and case studies.  
- Sensitivity to environment fidelity/diversity and agent variants.  
- Failure modes and qualitative examples.

### 8. Limitations
- Scope, assumptions, and known limitations of the work.

### 9. Broader Impact
- Potential societal impact, benefits/risks, and ethical considerations for large‑scale agent environments.

### 10. Conclusion
- Recap of contributions and results; future directions.
