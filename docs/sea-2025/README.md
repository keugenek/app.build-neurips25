## SEA 2025 Manuscript Workspace

This folder contains the markdown manuscript and assets for the NeurIPS 2025 SEA workshop submission.

### Structure
- `paper.md`: Markdown skeleton mirroring NeurIPS sections without LaTeX.  
- `assets/figures/`: Figures and diagrams (PNG/SVG/PDF).  
- `assets/tables/`: Tables or CSV/TSV data used for table generation.

### Conventions
- Write first in markdown; convert to LaTeX when ready to submit.  
- Keep figures under version control; large raw datasets should be stored externally.  
- Use descriptive filenames and reference them from `paper.md`.
