## Updated Data Analysis (tRPC only)

### Overall Metrics

- Total tRPC apps evaluated: 30
- Success (Score > 0): 21/30 = 70.0%
- Perfect scores (10/10): 9/30 = 30.0%
- Zero scores: 9/30 = 30.0%
- Mean score among functional apps: ≈ 8.78 (median: 9.5)

Apps passing both smoke tests (AB-01 and AB-02 not FAIL) achieved ≥9 in 17/22 cases (77.3%) and had a functional rate of 95.5% (21/22 > 0), confirming the strength of the scaffolding once initial gates are cleared.

### Score Distribution (tRPC)

| Score Bin | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| 10        | 9     |
| 9–9.9     | 8     |
| 8–8.9     | 2     |
| 7–7.9     | 1     |
| 6–6.9     | 1     |
| 0         | 9     |

### Check Outcomes (tRPC)

| Check | PASS | WARN | FAIL | NA | Pass Rate (excl. NA) |
|-------|------|------|------|----|-----------------------|
| AB-01 Boot | 25 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 83.3% |
| AB-02 Prompt | 19 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 70.4% |
| AB-03 Create | 22 | 2 | 0 | 6 | 91.7% |
| AB-04 View/Edit | 17 | 1 | 1 | 11 | 89.5% |
| AB-05 Clickable Sweep | 20 | 4 | 1 | 5 | 80.0% |
| AB-06 Performance (>75) | 23 | 3 | 0 | 4 | 88.5% |

### Failure Mode Analysis (from notes, tRPC only)

| Category | Count (approx.) | Description | Example Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Boot/Load failure | 3 | App does not start or template placeholder | "Template: Under Construction" |
| Missing/Incomplete code | 1 | Build/run impossible due to missing artifacts | "Incomplete / No Source Code" |
| CSP/security policy violation | 2 | Browser blocks media/images via CSP | "img-src 'self'"; media blocked by default-src |
| UI wiring/interaction defects | 3 | Controls not bound or actions not handled | "40% of the buttons don't work"; specific buttons dead |
| State/integration defects | 3 | Inconsistent state or incomplete flows | "needs refresh after creating account"; broken filters; login failure |
| Component misuse/runtime exceptions | 1 | Framework/component API misuse | "`RadioGroupItem` must be used within `RadioGroup`" |

Observations:
- Zero-score outcomes are explained by smoke test failures (boot/prompt) or missing artifacts.
- Most functional defects are localized (UI wiring/state), not systemic.
- CSP incidents occur but are less frequent in tRPC (2 cases), suggesting defaults are mostly safe.

### Recommendations (tRPC)

- Prevent template outputs and missing-artifact states (pre-flight validation, stronger generation contracts).
- Harden CSP/media handling where needed (static asset hosting, avoid eval, explicit media/img-src).
- Expand clickable-sweep to cover critical flows; surface unbound handlers.
- Add post-action invariants (persist-after-refresh) to catch state defects early.
